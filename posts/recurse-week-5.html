      <p>During week 5, I mostly dedicated my attention to a project I’m calling “concerto”, which I started <a href="recurse-week-3">in week three</a>. It places users in a virtual world and allows them to play music notes, and simulates the notes expanding around the world. My initial draft in week 3 used 2D rendering and very basic note synthesis; this week, I moved to 3D rendering. I started with some very basic ThreeJS tutorials and progressed to a globe of the Earth, with note indicators spreading out along its surface. I had to do a fair bit of math to figure out how to convert (lat, long) pairs into angles, move circles along given axes, or rotate circles appropriately so they cling to the sphere’s surface.</p>
<p>I also…</p>
<ul>
<li>Did a little work on my programming language as a brain-break. Now structs correctly call their children’s destructors when their own destructors run!</li>
<li>Started <a href="https://browser.engineering">the browser.engineering book</a> because a couple other folks in my batch are working through it. So far I’ve completed most of the chapter 1 exercises for making GET requests. The next step will be drawing things to the screen.</li>
<li>Published <a href="db-internals-basics">a blog post</a> of what I’ve learned about database internals!</li>
<li>Made a final stab at <code>wasmtime-dl</code>, my project to dynamically link libraries into wasmtime environments. I thought I had a great idea to overcome my previous roadblock, but it didn’t end up panning out. Expect a blog post soon.</li>

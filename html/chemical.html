				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				I was bored in chemistry class after finishing my work, and decided to create something fun.

				<h5> How does it work? </h5>
				The user inputs some string, and the program uses atomic symbols (H for Helium, Fe for Iron, etc.) to recreate the string. For example, Bacon would become BaCON (Barium Carbon Oxygen Nitrogen.)

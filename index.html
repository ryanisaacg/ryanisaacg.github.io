<p>My open-source projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/">GitHub</a>;
I sometimes talk about them <a href="code/">here on my blog.</a> I developed and maintained a game framework called <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a library for writing <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> games for desktop and web. I've also made a handful of <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/rebound">small</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/hellevator">video</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/interplanet">games</a>.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">table-top roleplaying / pen and paper games</a>.

                    <h3> A Game Every Month </h3>
                </a>

            </header>
            <p>For the past couple years I've been playing around with tabeletop RPG design. My goal was to make a comprehensive hack of a game like <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a> or <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/spire-rpg/"><em>Spire: The City Must Fall</em></a>,
but none of my attempts panned out. I found myself caught in a rut of moving from big project to big project as they collapsed under their own weight. To break the cycle, I set myself a challenge: make an RPG (or at least <em>something</em> RPG-related) every month of 2021.</p>

            <p>If your browser is set to dark mode by default, you've probably noticed the site looks different! I now have some dark mode CSS, so this blog isn't eye-searingly white if everything else is dark on your screen.</p>

            <p>So this is a post that's been bouncing around my head for a while, in one form or another. I created and maintain <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a 2D game framework for creating games for desktop and the web. The reason I'm writing this post is that I also haven't <em>used</em> Quicksilver to make anything for over a year.</p>

                    <h3> A New Quicksilver Crate, Elefont </h3>

            <p>This blog post has been a long time delayed, but late is better than never! The Quicksilver alpha is humming along, with bugs and API problems being addressed. While that work continues, I want to unveil <code>elefont</code>, a crate that I've developed for font caching.</p>

            <p>Out with the old, in with the new! After some frustration with Hugo, I've moved to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> and some light CSS.</p>

    "I used the project to learn the Godot engine, and also to experiment with game design. The game may not be extremely effective but it was a good learning experience for learning to convey emotions through mechanics."],
    ["How does it play?", "The game attempts to use game mechanics to convey the five stages of grief to the player.",
    "<br/> First it forces the player to repeat the same actions in hope they will succeed, modelling <b>Denial.</b> ",
    "<br/> Second it puts the player through a frustrating platforming puzzles, modelling <b>Anger.</b> <br/> Third , ",
    "modelling <b>Bargaining</b>, the player must give up their ability to jump temporarily. <br/>",
    "Fourth, as the player progresses through what should be an easy segment, their jump weakens and their movement slows, modelling <b>Depression.</b> <br/>",
    "Fifth, a puzzle forces the player to achieve <b> Acceptance. </b>"]]

      <description>Often your application might want to store gamestate or configurations, but the web has no filesystem access. Additionally, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to just dump files in the user&amp;rsquo;s home directory; each desktop operating system has a different preferred location for storing application-specific data, and often different locations for different kinds of data.
Introducing gestalt, a library that bundles up your data and stores it away so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to. A sample to save some game state:</description>

      <description>This year saw the release of async/.await in stable Rust, marking a huge change in how asynchronous code is written. Previously, one would have to chain a series of combinators onto a Future instance to accomplish asyncrhonous tasks. In Quicksilver, this was used for asset loading (for compatibility with the web backend), and has been a frequent source of pain.
Something as simple as loading a file, reading its contents, and loading a series of images based on those contents might look like this psuedo-Rust:</description>

      <description>I started this year with a blog post about the state of Quicksilver where I set a goal for myself: get web support for important game development crates upstreamed. At the end of the year, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to update this work (by me and many others!) has been a success, and the core of Rust&amp;rsquo;s game ecosystem is now-web enabled. In the future, I want to write a brief overview of those changes, but for now I want to focus on their relevance to Quicksilver.</description>

      <description>So www.ryanisaacg.com has a very new look, powered by Hugo and my (fairly small) fork of the hello-friend-ng theme. Partly the site will be dedicated to a bit of a professional showcase / bio for myself, but also with added blog functionality I can communicate in a more public way about my plans for my open source projects.
The State of Quicksilver that I wrote earlier this year has moved from its previous home as Github gist to retroactively being a post here, as I feel more comfortable linking to my writing in a domain that I control and can ensure the links stay live.</description>

      <description>What is Quicksilver? For anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, Quicksilver is my 2D game framework that targets desktop and web. It is a pure-Rust library that focuses on ergonomics and simplicity.
The State of Rust (WASM) Game Development Quicksilver is part of a small (but growing) set of Rust game engines. Notable are the Amethyst project, an open-source game engine, and ggez, a LOVE-inspired 2D game framework. Increasingly it is practical to build an entire game with only the Rust toolchain: winit provides windowing, a variety of crates allow access to platform graphics APIs, rodio provides sound, rusttype for font rendering, etc.</description>

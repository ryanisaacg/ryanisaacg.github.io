				<h5> Written In </h5>
				This project was written in Python.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				I felt that scripting in Makefile was lacking, and that I wanted to be able to create more complex rules. Additionally, this will run on any platform Python is on, unlike Makefile, which requires a Unix shell.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> How does it work? </h5>
				The program uses filesystem metadata to see which targets need to be rebuilt from which source code

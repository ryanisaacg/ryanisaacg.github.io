            <p>Recently I built a little tool I call <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/mirror-darkly">Mirror Darkly</a><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>. It exports my blog posts from an <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> vault to the blog’s git repo.</p>
<p>The meat of the work is being done by the excellent <a href="https://crates.io/crates/obsidian-export"><code>obsidian-export</code></a> crate and its dependencies. Mirror Darkly adds a few features on top:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can define a JSON config to map multiple paths within one vault to various locations on the filesystem (for example, I have my index page, static image folder, and posts folder all mapped).</li>
<li>All files at the destination folder will be overwritten (preventing stale files from sticking around), except for specific allowlisted files. This lets me keep config files stored in my git repo but not Obsidian.</li>
<li>Links are rewritten to be HTML-friendly.</li>
<li>I organize my blog posts with the date in the file name, for easy skimming. This means that the link targets have the date in their name in Obsidian; Mirror Darkly strips it out when writing the files for my blog to consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a few more features planned (like dead link detection, for one) and I might release a version of my janky Obsidian extension that shells out to Mirror Darkly.</p>
<p>Mirror Darkly solves my idiosyncratic problems and may not address yours at all. That’s fine—take it as an ad to write tiny software just for yourself.

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Somewhat regrettably, I’m watching the early 2000’s TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a>. The name of this project is pulled from the series finale’s title, “In a Mirror, Darkly”. I haven’t even gotten there yet, but the phrase is so evocative! Plus I’m mirroring contents from my Obsidian vault; Obsidian is used to make a dark mirror; and it’s a markdown (MD) tool. So the name is actually really clever and not inspired by one of the worst television shows I’ve ever seen. <a href="#fnref1" aria-label="Back to reference 1" role="doc-backlink" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>This isn’t an existing phrase as far as I know, but the closest I can think of is “barefoot developers” which a) is a little more granola than my vibe and b) is maybe tied in up in some AI stuff. I guess this is <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/technology/2004-03-30-shirky-situatedsoftware.html">situated software</a> but even smaller: I’m not building for dozens of users, I’m building for one user in particular. <a href="#fnref2" aria-label="Back to reference 2" role="doc-backlink" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

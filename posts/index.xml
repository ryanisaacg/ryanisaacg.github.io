            <description>I started this year with a blog post about the state of Quicksilver where I set a goal for myself: get web support for important game development crates upstreamed. At the end of the year, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to update this work (by me and many others!) has been a success, and the core of Rust&amp;rsquo;s game ecosystem is now-web enabled. In the future, I want to write a brief overview of those changes, but for now I want to focus on their relevance to Quicksilver.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started this year with a <a href="../state-of-quicksilver-feb-2019">blog post about the state of Quicksilver</a> where I set a goal for myself: get web support for important game development crates upstreamed. At the end of the year, I&rsquo;m happy to update this work (by me and many others!) has been a success, and the core of Rust&rsquo;s game ecosystem is now-web enabled. In the future, I want to write a brief overview of those changes, but for now I want to focus on their relevance to Quicksilver.</p>

<p>Without having to maintain my own set of web bindings for Quicksilver, I was able to start working on significant changes to both the internal and external structure. There are a few entirely unrelated modules in Quicksilver that are all needed for the framework: handling filesystem resources, creating and loading local data, the event loop, the graphics API, and the sound API. It makes sense to allow users to pick and choose these systems, which is the goal of Quicksilver&rsquo;s optional features. However, that still requires depending on Quicksilver, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense for some projects. Instead, I&rsquo;ve created a few new crates that anyone can drop into their project without pulling in any other Quicksilver-related code.</p>

<p>Additionally, a major new Rust feature landed this year: async/await. Quicksilver&rsquo;s asset loading system has been a sticking point, because of its design decisions and the inherent pain of combinator-based <code>Future</code> code. With <code>async</code> and <code>.await</code>, a new asynchronous asset loading API can be almost seamless. Combined with fixes to long-standing graphics API problems, I&rsquo;ve been working on a new major release for Quicksilver (which will be the first breaking change in over a year.)</p>

<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah">Chanukah</a> starts tonight, I&rsquo;m going to share these new crates and big Quicksilver updates over the next eight days. I can&rsquo;t promise I&rsquo;ll actually stick to this schedule, but my goal is:</p>

<ol>
<li>This post!</li>
<li><code>platter</code>: An async file-loading API for desktop and web</li>
<li><code>gestalt</code>: An API to manage bundling and saving data locally on desktop and web</li>
<li><code>blinds</code>: An easy-to-use async wrapper of <code>winit</code></li>
<li><code>golem</code>: An opinionated mostly-safe graphics library for desktop and web GL</li>
<li>Changes to the Quicksilver application lifecycle</li>
<li>Changes to the Quicskilver graphics API</li>
<li>An overview of the work on web support this year</li>
</ol>

            <description>So www.ryanisaacg.com has a very new look, powered by Hugo and my (fairly small) fork of the hello-friend-ng theme. Partly the site will be dedicated to a bit of a professional showcase / bio for myself, but also with added blog functionality I can communicate in a more public way about my plans for my open source projects.
The State of Quicksilver that I wrote earlier this year has moved from its previous home as Github gist to retroactively being a post here, as I feel more comfortable linking to my writing in a domain that I control and can ensure the links stay live.</description>

<p>The State of Quicksilver that I wrote earlier this year has moved from its previous home as Github gist to retroactively being a post here, as I feel more comfortable linking to my writing in a domain that I control and can ensure the links stay live. The Quicksilver website itself is still hosted within the Quicksilver repo, partially for ease of version control (if a commit changes code, it can change the website docs in lockstep) and partially because I&rsquo;m not sure how much I want to present Quicksilver as being <em>my project</em> versus the <em>Quicksilver project</em>. I&rsquo;m too cheap and lazy to buy a quicksilver domain, so the URL still contains my screen name, but the website is independent of the rest of ryanisaacg.com. Future State-Of-Quicksilver posts will also live on this blog though, as my personal plans for the project and my work for the Rust ecosystem feel out-of-band for the actual Quicksilver site.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be embedding Disqus for comments, but if you want to chat I&rsquo;m on the <a href="https://bit.ly/rust-community">Rust Community Discord</a> as @ryanisaacg. I&rsquo;d love to hear people&rsquo;s thoughts on the new look, if Quicksilver should be moved to a sub-page of this site, and if State of Quicksilver should be a gist, blog posts here, or some combination.</p>

            <description>What is Quicksilver? For anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, Quicksilver is my 2D game framework that targets desktop and web. It is a pure-Rust library that focuses on ergonomics and simplicity.
The State of Rust (WASM) Game Development Quicksilver is part of a small (but growing) set of Rust game engines. Notable are the Amethyst project, an open-source game engine, and ggez, a LOVE-inspired 2D game framework. Increasingly it is practical to build an entire game with only the Rust toolchain: winit provides windowing, a variety of crates allow access to platform graphics APIs, rodio provides sound, rusttype for font rendering, etc.</description>

<h2 id="what-is-quicksilver">What is Quicksilver?</h2>

<p>For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> is my 2D game framework that targets desktop and web. It is a pure-Rust library that focuses on ergonomics and simplicity.</p>

<h2 id="the-state-of-rust-wasm-game-development">The State of Rust (WASM) Game Development</h2>

<p>Quicksilver is part of a small (but growing) set of Rust game engines. Notable are the Amethyst project, an open-source game engine, and ggez, a LOVE-inspired 2D game framework.
Increasingly it is practical to build an entire game with only the Rust toolchain: winit provides windowing, a variety of crates allow access to platform graphics APIs, rodio provides sound, rusttype for font rendering, etc. A pure-Rust game framework is getting easier to make all the time.</p>

<p>However, very few libraries support WASM out of the box. This means Quicksilver and Rust WASM games in general essentially have small implementations of windowing, event handling, sounds, graphics, and input for the web that have not been contributed upstream.</p>

<h2 id="the-framework-problem">The Framework Problem</h2>

<p>Opting to use Quicksilver for some feature (web support, API design, automatic batching) requires opting into <em>all</em> of Quicksilver&rsquo;s features. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily great! Even with compile-time feature flags available, it&rsquo;s hard to do any Quicksilver code without buying into the State trait. This boils down to the vision of Quicksilver as a framework: if you can just plug in Quicksilver and start making a game right away, it needs to be everything to everyone.</p>

<p>Partly this is due to Quicksilver&rsquo;s history as a bit of a learning project for me, which I wanted to build from scratch in as many places as possible. It&rsquo;s also caused by my impatience: the Rust ecosystem is amazing and featureful, but waiting for every single upstream project to accept changes would mean that Quicksilver could only be developed as fast as its slowest dependency. I tend to have time to work on the project in bursts, when I clear out the bug backlog and implement a few features from the roadmap; this doesn&rsquo;t mesh well with long-running interactions with other projects. The way I&rsquo;ve handled this in the past is writing my own Javascript bindings for each feature, essentially cloning an entire crate.</p>

<h2 id="the-fundamentals">The Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Largely, Quicksilver&rsquo;s API is approaching a state of stability. It accomplishes most of what I want it to, in a way I&rsquo;m largely satisfied with. For end users, the Quicksilver project has been more or less stable for a few months, and no substantial breaking changes are planned for the future.</p>

<p>However, Quicksilver still has quite a few systems implemented by a dependency and an ad-hoc web clone of that dependency. This is what I hope to change, by contributing web backends across the ecosystem. My ideal outcome is that the fundamental multimedia crates (winit, rodio, gilrs, etc.) can run on WASM out-of-the-box.</p>

<h2 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h2>

<p>If it sounds like my current goal is to make Quicksilver obsolete, that wouldn&rsquo;t be too far off. Quicksilver&rsquo;s raison d&rsquo;etre is packaging up a bundle of functionality and to provide a single API for both web and native. Moving the ecosystem to support web and native makes this less important. Parts of Quicksilver that I think are particularly useful will probably become their own crates (re-exported in Quicksilver) to allow their use outside the framework. Some future version of Quicksilver may just be entirely a re-export of various crates and types with a consistent organization.</p>

<p>In essence, I want seamless desktop and WASM development to move from a selling point of developing games in Quicksilver to a selling point of developing games in Rust.</p>

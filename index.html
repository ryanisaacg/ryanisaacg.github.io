                <h2 id="wave-hi-i-m-ryan">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan</h2>
<p>My pronouns are they/them or he/him (no preference).
I'm a software engineer and a hobbyist game developer/writer.</p>
<p>I work on knowledge management and collaboration tools, though I'm also interested in tools for creatives and artists, as well as communications platforms.</p>
<p>My open-source projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/">GitHub</a>;
I sometimes talk about them <a href="posts/">here on my blog.</a> My focus used to be game development; I developed and maintain a game framework called <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a library for writing <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> games for desktop and web. I've also made a handful of <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/rebound">small</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/hellevator">video</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/interplanet">games</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I'm writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">table-top roleplaying games</a>. I've published <a href="https://ryanisaacg.itch.io/on-the-wrong-side-of-infinity">one</a>, and I'm actively working on another.</p>
<p>If you want to get in contact, you can reach me <a href="mailto:ryan@ryanisaacg.com">via email</a>.</p>

                    <h3> Quicksilver and Open Source </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>So this is a post that's been bouncing around my head for a while, in one form or another. I created and maintain <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a 2D game framework for creating games for desktop and the web. The reason I'm writing this post is that I also haven't <em>used</em> Quicksilver to make anything for over a year.</p>

                    <h3> A New Quicksilver Crate, Elefont </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>This blog post has been a long time delayed, but late is better than never! The Quicksilver alpha is humming along, with bugs and API problems being addressed. While that work continues, I want to unveil <code>elefont</code>, a crate that I've developed for font caching.</p>

            <p>Out with the old, in with the new! After some frustration with Hugo, I've moved to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> and some light CSS.</p>

                    <h3> A Quicksilver Chanukah, Day 8: Rust Gamedev and the Web </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>This year has been great for Rust gamedev on the web. Huge progress has been made towards a full game stack being available more-or-less &quot;for free:&quot; most of the foundational crates have available web support, in one way or another.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>The graphics API of Quicksilver isn't as dire need of a rework as the <a href="../quicksilver-chanukah-2019-day-6">lifecycle APIs</a>, but I wanted to take the next breaking change as an opportunity to address some long-standing issues. </p>

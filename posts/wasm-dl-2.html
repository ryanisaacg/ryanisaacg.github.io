      <ul>
<li>Initial thought was to drive with data</li>
<li>Massive combinatorial explosion python script</li>
<li>Refined down</li>
<li>Realized I can and should just read the wasm import section</li>
<li>given the import section tried some trait stuff and macro stuff, couldn’t figure it out</li>
<li>punning a ValRaw that represents a float to a u32 was difficult, to_bits and from_bits were producing the wrong results</li>
<li>Eventually reached for a transmute (safe transmute through bytemuck), need to take the u32, convert to f32, then transmute it back</li>
<li>Can’t use the wasm import section, at least not entirely - pointers!</li>
</ul>

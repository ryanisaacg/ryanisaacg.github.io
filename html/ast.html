				<h5> Written In </h5>
				This project was written in C.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				The project was an mimicing the job of the last stage of a compiler: 
                turning an abstract representation of code into some emitted code.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> How does it work? </h5>
				Each node is an operator or value, and each leaf is a value. 
                This project was my first step towards writing compilers that targeted C, 
                as it turns a data structure into executable C code.

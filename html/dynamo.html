                <h5> Abstract </h5>
                DYNAMO is applied research, the core of which is fueled by data created by Wireless Network Sensors. 
                DYNAMO used GPS, active and passive RFID, and drone video sensors. Data from these actual sensors plus 
                data from a DYNAMO Simulation Toolkit, built as part of the project, was used to illustrate systems and 
                applications that would derive value from this sensor data. These applications include monitoring athletes 
                competing in the Rio Olympics triathlon, tracking 1st responders in an active shooter incident at Monmouth 
                University, and conducting a water search for remnants of an air disaster.

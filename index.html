		<h2>Your Website Looks Old/Weird/Simple, Why?</h2>
		This website is a very simple HTML document, hosted on Github. It is
		probably one of the fastest-loading sites you've visited today, if not
		the fastest to load. Of course, it helps that Github uses Amazon Web
		Services, which is backed by one of the leading companies when it comes
		to throwing bytes around network cables. Still, I could have used a
		web framework like Bootstrap. Bootstrap, still zipped after a download,
		is 279 KB. Unzipped, it is 1 MB. This site is less than 100KB, which
		means that adding Bootstrap would be a more than 10 times increase in the
		"weight" of this site. With less than a kilobyte of CSS and markup, I
		was able to present the information I needed to in a not-hideous way.
		A modern smartphone would rank as a supercomputer at
		the turn the millenium. Still, webpages haven't become much faster over
		the past decade and a half since. The Web doesn't need to be slow: <i>we</i>
		made it slow.

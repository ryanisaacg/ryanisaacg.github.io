        <p>This year I've been playing <a href="https://liberigothica.itch.io/fellowship-a-tabletop-adventure-game">Fellowship 2e</a>, a fantasy adventure RPG that's <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/">Powered by the Apocalypse</a>, and I have a few gripes with an otherwise great game. Since session 1, I've felt like the core move Get Away needs re-writing, and I decided to take a stab at it.</p>

        <p>Recently I found myself tracking down a handful of regressions: bugs I knew hadn't existed just a week or two before. I vaguely knew that there was a git command that could help me, but I had never really put it to serious use. Now that I have used it, I find myself falling in love with <code>git bisect</code>.</p>

        <p>For the past couple years I've been playing around with tabletop RPG design. My goal was to make a comprehensive hack of a game like <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a> or <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/spire-rpg/"><em>Spire: The City Must Fall</em></a>,
but none of my attempts panned out. I found myself caught in a rut of moving from big project to big project as they collapsed under their own weight. To break the cycle, I set myself a challenge: make an RPG (or at least <em>something</em> RPG-related) every month of 2021.</p>

        <p>If your browser is set to dark mode by default, you've probably noticed the site looks different! I now have some dark mode CSS, so this blog isn't eye-searingly white if everything else is dark on your screen.</p>

        <p>So this is a post that's been bouncing around my head for a while, in one form or another. I created and maintain <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a 2D game framework for creating games for desktop and the web. The reason I'm writing this post is that I also haven't <em>used</em> Quicksilver to make anything for over a year.</p>

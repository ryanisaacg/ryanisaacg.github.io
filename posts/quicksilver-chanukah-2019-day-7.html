            <p>The graphics API of Quicksilver isn’t as dire need of a rework as the <a href="../quicksilver-chanukah-2019-day-6">lifecycle APIs</a>, but I wanted to take the next breaking change as an opportunity to address some long-standing issues.</p>
<p>In no particular order, they are:</p>
<h2 id="low-level-access">Low-Level Access</h2>
<p>As it stands, Quicksilver talks to a very specific backend design for graphics. The API is internal-only and designed to wrap up all the GL code in one place, to keep the high-level drawing APIs platform independent. There’s no way to expose the raw GL API directly to the user, as the backend talks directly to OpenGL 3.2 and WebGL 1. With <code>glow</code>, we could expose a cross-platform OpenGL context, but there are still differences between desktop and web GL. These problems, like different ways of describing the input and output in GLSL, are addressed by <a href="../quicksilver-chanukah-2019-day-5"><code>golem</code> (see announcement from 2 days ago.)</a>.</p>
<p>Providing users access to a lower-level graphics API also frees the high-level API from trying to provide custom shader support. A custom shader is best served with custom vertex inputs, which means custom functions to turn high-level draw commands into low-level vertex data. Instead of trying to solve this problem in the general case, Quicksilver can provide the mechanism to solve it yourself.</p>
<h2 id="draw-order">Draw Order</h2>
<p>The previous graphics API aggressively batches draws, including re-ordering <code>draw</code> commands to avoid changing state while rendering. If a <code>z</code> parameter (not included in the default, simple <code>draw</code>) is not provided, anything goes. Hypothetically this leads to faster rendering, but it also means that many users experience unexpected results with basic operations. The new API should be built on a simple draw-order guarantee: the first draw call is drawn furthest back, with each subsequent draw lying on top of the ones before it.</p>
<h2 id="render-to-texture">Render-To-Texture</h2>
<p>The <code>Surface</code> API supports render-to-texture, but it has a few problems. First, the API is unintuitive: rendering to a texture only works within a closure, for example. Also, it’s plain buggy. <code>golem</code> provides a harder-to-misuse API for off-screen rendering, which can be used to build a nicer abstraction in Quicksilver itself.</p>
<h2 id="screen-resizing-and-projection">Screen Resizing and Projection</h2>
<p>The current version of Quicksilver “magically” handles the window being resized, as well as projecting and unprojecting between world and screen coordinates. Often this is more trouble than it’s worth: you want your UI at one projection and letterbox, and your game content at another. By exposing a few more knobs to the user (like the GL viewport), the <code>ResizeStrategy</code> API can be provided on top of other, orthogonal abstractions.</p>

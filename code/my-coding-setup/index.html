                <p>TODO: clever, snappy title (&quot;Computing like it's 1999&quot;)</p>
<p>I get questions about my development setup from time to time, so I figured I may as well write a post that I can pull out that explains everything clearly.</p>
<p>TODO: backstory for why I'm like this</p>
<p>Let's work our way out from the editor to the operating system: I use <a href="TODO">neovim</a>. It's like vim, but neo! Killer features include built-in lua configuration and scripting support, async and terminal embedding (since upstreamed to Vim 8, is my understanding), and built-in support for the <a href="TODO">Language Server Protocol</a>. LSP is the really killer tool here; it gives me all of the niceties of an IDE without ever leaving my terminal. TODO: extensions</p>
<p>Out one layer from the editor is the shell. Personally I run <a href="TODO">fish shell</a> and have for years, after a fair stint with zsh. Fish has sensible and pleasant defaults out of the box, and is a fair bit nicer to script in than its more standard cousins like bash. These days, a shell doesn't feel complete to me without <a href="TODO">fzf</a> (for finding files quickly) and <a href="TODO">rg</a> (for finding contents quickly). That's about all there is to it!</p>
<p>Very rarely am I doing serious work in a shell without that shell sitting in <a href="TODO">tmux</a>. This is one piece of my setup that feels the least critical; any decent terminal can do splits and tabs on its own nowadays. I picked up the habit while ssh'ing, though, and all the keyboard shortcuts feel like second nature. Plus it persists my sessions when I accidentally close a terminal tab, which is a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Lastly, we get to the terminal emulator. My preferred terminal is <a href="TODO">iTerm 2</a>; its UI just feels slicker and more put-together than other options. This is one of the only reasons I prefer macOS to Linux, if I'm being entirely honest.</p>

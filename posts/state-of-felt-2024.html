    <article><p>Over the past year-and-change I’ve been working on a hobby programming language called Felt<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>. Felt is a language designed for arts and crafts: it’s for small programs (either practical or fun) that don’t need industrial strength. I <a href="programming-language-for-fun">last wrote about it</a> during my batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, and that blog post remains a good overview of the general vibe and goals of the project.</p>
<p>I think of Felt as bringing a systems-programming mindset to a high-level language. I want to take the core innovation of Rust (state may either be mutable or aliased but never both) and package it into a simpler language that’s easier to learn, write, and iterate on. The prototypical Felt program is a web game or toy<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup>, something where memory locality matters but a reference counter won’t be performance-crushing.</p>
<h2>What’s There</h2>
<ul>
<li>A non-optimizing, whole-program compiler which outputs WASM<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></sup>
<ul>
<li>There’s a basic type-checker (though the type system is also basic so it’s fine)</li>
<li>There’s a borrow-checker, which is currently Good Enough™️. Borrows are second-class and limited to the scope they’re created, so checking them isn’t too hard</li>
<li>Polymorphism is currently provided through Go-like interfaces, available on both structs and unions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A basic LSP (that doesn’t understand imports at all, which is a major stumbling point)</li>
<li>A treesitter grammar</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s Planned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Generics (either monomorphic or not). This is a big goal for 2025</li>
<li>Containers. There are growable arrays and reference counted boxes provided as compiler built-ins. There are also dictionaries, but they only support integer keys because I’m not sure how to allow custom types without a ton of compiler machinery. My plan is to add enough to the language that containers can be implemented as part of a standard library, which will solve this problem</li>
<li>Packages</li>
<li>Function references</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
<li>Coroutines</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>Much of the compiler is written from scratch without consulting prior art. This is part of the fun for me, but I’m sure it means I’ve made suboptimal decisions. <a href="#fnref3" aria-label="Back to reference 3" role="doc-backlink" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

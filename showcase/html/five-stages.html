The game may not be extremely effective but it was a good learning experience for learning to convey emotions through mechanics.</section><h5> How does it play? </h5><section>The game attempts to use game mechanics to convey the five stages of grief to the player.

<br/> Second it puts the player through a frustrating platforming puzzles, modelling <b>Anger.</b> <br/> Third ,

Fourth, as the player progresses through what should be an easy segment, their jump weakens and their movement slows, modelling <b>Depression.</b> <br/>
Fifth, a puzzle forces the player to achieve <b> Acceptance. </b></section></article><nav><button type="button" onclick="gohome()"> Home </button><button type="button" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/ryanisaacg/FiveStages')"> Github </button></nav></body></html>

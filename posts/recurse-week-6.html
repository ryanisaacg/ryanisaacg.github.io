    <article><p>I’m halfway through my batch already! That can’t be true, can it? It feels like I just started!</p>
<p>This week I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focused on <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/concerto">Concerto</a>. I got decent-sounding bells synthesized via Web Audio, and rewrote the backend to sync notes between clients. After an afternoon of wrangling with GCP I got the project deployed, and showed it off at Thursday presentations.</li>
<li>Made some progress on my <a href="https://browser.engineering">browser.engineering</a> project, <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/shelves">shelves</a>. Thanks to some pairing with <a href="https://annahope.me/">Anna</a>, I now have a GUI where my rendered text appears.</li>
<li>Drafted my repeatedly-promised blog post about <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/wasmtime-dl/"><code>wasmtime-dl</code></a>. It needs a round of revisions, but I hope to have the post out this week.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of code written, this was my least productive week so far! Partly the wasmtime blog post is the longest I’ve written yet, and it took more time than I expected. This was also my first week presenting anything, and I’m out of practice putting a talk together. My hope is that this upcoming week will reverse my low-productivity trend!</p>

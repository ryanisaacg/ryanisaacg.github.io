      <p>In the last few years I’ve switched fully to Neovim, and embraced the lua scripting and built-in LSP support. Most development I do these days tends to be TypeScript or Rust, and my editor’s integration with tooling like prettier, rustfmt, rust-analyzer, and tsc is great! Having recently started doing some work in Unity, however, I discovered that I would have to get my hands dirty for a good C# experience.</p>
<p>I started off by searching around for other people’s experience using Neovim with Unity, and found <a href="https://chrislabarge.com/posts/neovim-unity-engine/">a decent blog post</a> that walked me through the basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure Unity to send a message over a Unix socket to neovim when you want to open a file</li>
<li>Create a script to launch neovim listening to that Unix socket</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t end up using exactly the solution they provide (<code>nvr</code> doesn’t seem to be available as part of my neovim install) but after reading the documentation for nvim’s <code>--remote</code> option I was able to set up this part of the ingration fine. When I opened a file in Unity, it would pop open in my vim session.</p>
<p>The logical next step is some sort of LSP integration. I went for the officially-supported omnisharp-roslyn and installed it on my system. The nvim-lsp documentation recommended the <code>omnisharp_extended</code> plugin for handling go-to-definition, so I added that to my config as well. My config ended up looking like this:</p>
<pre class="language-lua"><code class="language-lua">omnisharp <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<p>and it worked pretty well! I could open up my files from Unity, have them pop open in Neovim, and they were properly integrated with the C# LSP. Unfortunately omnisharp apparently won’t search your PATH for <code>OmniSharp.exe</code>, which means that this part of my config isn’t portable to other machines. Other than that, everything seemed just fine.</p>
<p>After using this setup for a few days I ran into a problem. Whenever I created a new C# file, omnisharp would be completely borked: anything it defined was unavailable in other files and all of the imports in the new file would be marked as unresolved. I could fix the problems by restarting my entire editor, but omnisharp’s long boot time makes that painful. At this point I thought was defeated and started to configure VSCode for C#. Fortunately, a new update to Neovim saved the day! In the GitHub issue someone pointed out that the issue was the LSP client not properly handling the <code>didChangeWatchedFiles</code> message from the server. Last week Neovim added experimental support for handling this in its LSP, so once you <a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/issues/2250#issuecomment-1499726992">enable it in the LSP capabilities</a> the new-file-problem goes away!</p>

<p>Upgrading Neovim, however, introduced a new problem. It seems like omnisharp-roslyn reports invalid tokens for the LSP semantic-highlighting feature, which trips up nvim. There’s a hacky workaround I’m using (that I found <a href="https://nicolaiarocci.com/making-csharp-and-omnisharp-play-well-with-neovim/">in a blog post</a>) which manually fixes the invalid tokens; hopefully omnisharp fixes the issue upstream soon.</p>
<p>That’s essentially where I’m leaving things for now: there are some hacks underlying my setup, but day-to-day everything works fine. I have a newfound appreciation for web dev tooling and the Rust project; this was definitely the most fiddly thing I’ve done with my editor in quite some time.</p>

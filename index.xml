      <description>About Me I&amp;rsquo;m studing Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. My main area of experience is PC game development, and I have had internships for both web and mobile applications. Most of my side projects are written either C, Java, Python, or Rust.
Professional Experience My professional experience so far is limited to internships and work in research labs. This past summer (2019) I worked as an intern at Facebook in the Connectivity organization.</description>

    ["How does it work?", 
    "The player controls the <i>CSS Merrimack</i> to fight the <i>USS Monitor</i> in a naval battle. They have the options to accelerate, deccelerate, bank to port, bank to staboard, and firing port or starboard guns. "],
    "Why play as the Confederacy?",
    "Originally, I planned to have the player take the role of the <i>Monitor</i>, but found it much easier to create a  computer-controlled opponent for the <i>Monitor</i>, because of its rotating turrets. Additionally, human players found maneuvering to land a broadside more satisfying than controlling a turret."]

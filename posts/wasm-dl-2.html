      <p><a href="programming-language-for-fun">My programming language</a> compiles to WebAssembly, which I run on desktop via <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">wasmtime</a>. TODO: explain more about why I want to link</p>
<p>When I ran into a linker error with SDL_image, I was thrust rudely back into the world of dynamic libraries, linker paths, and C ABIs. Usually I’ll do anything to avoid this, including <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">writing my own game framework from scratch</a>. But this week it served as a challenge: can I get at those sweet sweet capabilities without having to go through a layer of Rust bindings? What if I could load dynamic libraries from wasm itself?</p>
<p>Importantly, wasm is sandboxed by design. There are no mechanisms to reach outside that sandbox. Instead a wasm module can define “imports”, which may be a function, a global variable, a chunk of memory, or a table<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>. These imports are the only ways a wasm module can have side effects. In the browser, Javascript functions are used to satisfy imports; in wasmtime, you use Rust functions. My goal with <code>wasmtime-dl</code> was to allow those imports to be satisfied by a dynamic library provided at runtime, essentially punching a hole in the sandbox for my own convenience.</p>
<p>This would open up a bit of design space for native bindings in my programming language. Instead of need to inject all bindings into wasmtime by writing Rust code, my goal was an automatic TODO</p>
<p>I had no experience with using dynamic libraries in this way. Previously I had compiled C or Rust code that would use a dynamic library at runtime, but that sort of detail is handled for you<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Any time a wasm module has a side effect of any kind (printing to a console, painting to the screen, sending a web request) it must be</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial thought was to drive with data</li>
<li>Massive combinatorial explosion python script</li>
<li>Refined down</li>
<li>Realized I can and should just read the wasm import section</li>
<li>given the import section tried some trait stuff and macro stuff, couldn’t figure it out</li>
<li>punning a ValRaw that represents a float to a u32 was difficult, to_bits and from_bits were producing the wrong results</li>
<li>Eventually reached for a transmute (safe transmute through bytemuck), need to take the u32, convert to f32, then transmute it back</li>
<li>Can’t use the wasm import section, at least not entirely - pointers!</li>
</ul>

		<h4> Systems Applications / Compilers </h4>
		<article>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/AST"> <h5> AST </h5> </a>
				A small project that converts an Abstract Syntax Tree into C source code
				<aside>
					<h2> AST </h2>
					An Abstract Syntax Tree is an intermediate representation between source code and the compiler's output. 
					Each node is an operator or value, and each leaf is a value. 
					This project was my first step towards writing compilers that targeted C, as it was intend to turn a data structure into executable C code.
					I didn't wrap every feature of the C language with an AST feature, but enough that I learned critical parts of writing compiler infrastructure.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/fwum"> <h5> Fwum </h5> </a>
				A work-in-progress programming language with a compiler
				<aside>
					<h2> Fwum </h2>
					Fwum was created out of my frustration with other programming languages. 
					I found garbage collection unsatisfactory for game development, and reference counting just as bad, leaving just a few languages.
					Mainly, the candidates were C and C++, which are the too hot and too cold of a Goldilocks metaphor. 
					C wasn't quite featured enough for me, but C++ had too much complexity. 
					I created a grammar, a parser for the grammar, a semantic analyzer, a basic linker, and an output to C as a compile target for the language. 
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/IslandScript"> <h5> IslandScript </h5> </a>
				A Python-Inspired language that compiles to Javascript
				<aside>
					<h2> Island Script </h2>
					Island Script was my first compiler, intended to make the syntax of Javascript more like Python. 
					At the time, I believed semantic indentation was obviously the correct path, and wanted to be able to use it for web development.
					The language is nearly semantically identical to Javascript, with only minor semantic tweaks.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/Snakefile"> <h5> Snakefile </h5> </a>
				A build system in Python that is similar to Makefile (pun intended)
				<aside>
					<h2> Snakefile </h2>
					When I first started creating complex C projects, I was using a simple Makefile that mapped each source file to an object file. 
					However, changes to dependent headers would often break builds, which meant I was in need of a better solution. 
					Autotools was too complex, and I didn't like that CMake required learning an entire new Domain-Specific Language, so I created Snakefile.
					It is intended to allow creating complex, turing-complete build files and to be easy to configure. 
					However, incompatibility with Visual Studio project files eventually turned me away from the project.

		<h4> Desktop Software / Command Line Utilities </h4>
		<article>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/ChemicalWriter"> <h5> Chemical Writer </h5> </a>
				A program that converts a string into atomic symbols, using Python
				<aside>
					<h2> Chemical Writer </h2>
					This is more of a toy than a utility, but it's fun to play around with. It converts "BACON" to Barium, Carbon, Oxygen, and Nitrogen (BaCON). 
					It is guaranteed to find a solution if it exists, and will prioritize single-element.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/CLChat"> <h5> CLChat </h5> </a>
				A basic chatroom that runs over TCP/IP, using Java
				<aside>
					<h2> CLChat </h2>
					This was mostly for me to learn the basiscs of a networked TCP application development and creating a server that can manage many clients at once.
					The server should scale to an arbitrary number of clients, but the architecture means it will probably decrease greatly in performance under
					heavy message load.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/fwumdestego"> <h5> FwumDeStego </h5> </a>
				A stegnonography program that can encode text in images, using Java
				<aside>
					<h2> FwumDeStego </h2>
					The program converts a string to a bitstring and maps it over the RGB values of the image. Even values indicate a 0 in the bitstring and odd 
					values indicate a 1 in the bitstring. To read the value from the image, it follows the same order and uses modulo to read the string. 
					The changes to the RGB values are invisible to the human eye but allow for the transmission of information.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/speech-generator"> <h5> Speech Generator </h5> </a>
				A program that takes written human speech, analyzes it, and attempts to create the most similar string of words, using Python
				<aside>
					<h2> Speech Generator </h2>
					The program analyzes what words follow others most often, and attempts to reconstruct the same pattern and write in a similar fashion.
					It is a rather naive implementation that only takes a basic context, and most often generates nonsense. 
					However, this is a basic demo of what a Markov chain is like.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/spacey"> <h5> Spacey </h5> </a>
				A program that manages the type of indentation a piece of source code has, using C++
				<aside>
					<h2> Spacey </h2>
					Especially in Python code, mixing of tabs and spaces to indent can cause problems. 
					The objective of the program is to take all of the indentation and make it all tabs or all spaces.
					It's a relatively simple program, which I wrote to learn string manipulation in C++.

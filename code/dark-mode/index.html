<p>Under the hood I'm using a neat CSS feature called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables</a> to switch the colors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this means old posts with syntax highlighting have lost syntax highlighting, because setting up theme-specific highlights looked a little annoying. That's not really a big deal to me, but I might fix it eventually.</p>

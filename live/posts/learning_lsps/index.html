        <p>As part of <a href="programming-language-for-fun">my programming language project</a>, I’ve been writing a language server. I’m familiar with the very basics of the <a href="">language server protocol LINK TODO</a> from integrating neovim with projects like <code>rust-analyzer</code>, but this is the first time I’ve dug into the internals.</p>
<p>At its most basic, LSP consists of JSON messages exchanged between a server and a client. The server understands the programming language and does all the processing. The client[^clients] interacts with the server in a high-level way, abstracting the difference between programming languages. Most exchanges involve a request from the client and a response from the server, some go the other direction (the server requests and the client responds), and others go one way (called “notifications” in the LSP spec).</p>
<p>Different clients and servers can have different “capabilities”, which they exchange during initial connection. For example, there’s a capability for “go to definition” which the server may or may not have. If a server doesn’t advertise a capability, the client should r</p>

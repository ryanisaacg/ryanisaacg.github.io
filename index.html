                    <h3> Quicksilver and Open Source </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>So this is a post that's been bouncing around my head for a while, in one form or another. I created and maintain <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a 2D game framework for creating games for desktop and the web. The reason I'm writing this post is that I also haven't <em>used</em> Quicksilver to make anything for over a year.</p>

                    <h3> A New Quicksilver Crate, Elefont </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>This blog post has been a long time delayed, but late is better than never! The Quicksilver alpha is humming along, with bugs and API problems being addressed. While that work continues, I want to unveil <code>elefont</code>, a crate that I've developed for font caching.</p>

                    <h3> A Quicksilver Chanukah, Day 8: Rust Gamedev and the Web </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>This year has been great for Rust gamedev on the web. Huge progress has been made towards a full game stack being available more-or-less &quot;for free:&quot; most of the foundational crates have available web support, in one way or another.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>The graphics API of Quicksilver isn't as dire need of a rework as the <a href="../quicksilver-chanukah-2019-day-6">lifecycle APIs</a>, but I wanted to take the next breaking change as an opportunity to address some long-standing issues. </p>

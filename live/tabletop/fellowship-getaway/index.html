        <p>This year I’ve been playing <a href="https://liberigothica.itch.io/fellowship-a-tabletop-adventure-game">Fellowship 2e</a>, a fantasy adventure RPG that’s <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/">Powered by the Apocalypse</a>, and I have a few gripes with an otherwise great game. Since session 1, I’ve felt like the core move Get Away needs re-writing, and I decided to take a stab at it.</p>

<p>The relevant move:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you need to get somewhere out of reach or out of sight, tell us where you’re going and roll +Grace. If you have the Clumsy tag, you take -1 to Get Away. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get there quickly, avoiding any harm along the way.</li>
<li>You get there quietly, drawing no attention.</li>
<li>You grab someone nearby and bring them along with you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things bother me. First, I think “You grab someone nearby and bring them along with you” has only been picked a handful of times in ten sessions of play at my table. It’s just not very useful in most situations. The other is the move’s use of “negative choices”; the player is choosing things that <em>don’t</em> happen, rather than things that <em>do.</em> This can put the GM in an awkward situation: if you <em>don’t</em> choose “drawing no attention”, does that necessarily mean you <em>do</em> draw attention? Does it depend on the situation?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I read <a href="https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/negative-pick-lists/1867/2">a Gauntlet post</a> by Jeremy Strandberg, author of the upcoming <a href="https://stonetop.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders/">Stonetop</a>, a little while ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So if you’re going to use moves that have you chose “avoid negative” options, you kind of have to assume that some players/GMs will take it one way, and others will take it another, and ask yourself if you’re okay with either interpretation.</p>
<p><em>Or</em> you can make it clear via the move’s text which you intend. A few ways to do that. You can set the default in the “body” of the move and then let choices counter/add to the default. I think this works well for moves that mix and match “positive” and “avoid negative” choices.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Personally, I <em>generally</em> try to avoid moves with “__ doesn’t happen” choices. I find that moves are cleaner and easier to understand when the choices are “positive” (as in: pick things that do happen, good or bad) rather than “negative” (as in: picking things that <em>don’t</em> happen).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, I thought about the move. It’s not hard to imagine this being a “positive” list (as in ‘pick things that happen’, not ‘things that are positive’), at least for the first two options. The third is a little harder, but I think with a little tweaking it could work. Here’s what I’m running now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you need to get somewhere out of reach or out of sight, tell us where you’re going and roll +Grace. If you have the Clumsy tag, you take -1 to Get Away. On any hit, you get where you’re going; on a 7-9, choose one:</p>
<ul>
<li>You take a treacherous route, and take damage along the way</li>
<li>You leave yourself open to being spotted or trailed</li>
<li>You leave subtly or suddenly, with your allies behind and none the wiser. You cannot choose this option while working alone</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I see a few advantages. Importantly, this move is just friendlier to players. Often something that requires a character Get Away can also be Overcome (Fellowship’s catch-all move for avoiding harm). Overcome’s 10+ condition leaves the character perfectly fine; why not the same for Get Away? The new move also makes the outcome clear: on a 7-9, the player chooses something bad that happens, rather than taking one possible option off the table. You can either be damaged, followed, or abandon your allies. I chose to make the last option sting a little more, and also close off its use in solo scenarios.</p>
<p>This isn’t the only tweak I’ve made to Fellowship, and I may have more to say about my ongoing game and the hacks I’ve made later. For now, if you use this in your own game, <a href="mailto:ryan@ryanisaacg.com">let me know</a>!</p>

            <p>As I said in <a href="recurse-week-9">week 9</a>, personal life and my job search were headwinds on the last chunk of my batch. In the last quarter I didn’t have time to write individual week-summary posts, so instead I’ll group them all here.</p>
<p>Over the last three weeks of my batch, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewrote Brick’s error handling. Instead of dumping the <code>Debug</code> representation of errors, it now gives the location and error message in a readable format.</li>
<li>Wrote <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/vinyl">a tiny website</a> to allow folks on my local network to upload music to the household plex server.</li>
<li>For “half-baked demos”, I <a href="https://ryanisaacg.com/webrick/">put Brick in a webpage</a>. It’s actually pretty simple! I created a tiny Rust crate which provides a wasm export that compiles Brick source to wasm. Then I hooked that up to a text editor and displayed the output in HTML.</li>
<li>Added support for autocloned refcounts to Brick. This is the first step towards persistent data structure support in the language; more in a forthcoming Brick-specific blogpost.</li>
<li>Created a Treesitter grammar for Brick. The first-order benefit is that I have syntax highlighting now! Hopefully I can also use this to power other tools, like the language server, in the future.</li>
<li>Gave a presentation on Brick. The reception was so positive that I’m considering taking the project a little more seriously than I have been (though my first priority is still to have fun).</li>
<li>Never-graduated! My batch is now over and I’m an RC alum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect to see more RC wrap-up around here: a “return statement” (retrospective post), some projects that I haven’t yet posted about, and some blog drafts I still need to polish. After that post volume will drop off quite a bit, what with the end of my Recurse batch and full-time employment on the horizon.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>This year has been great for Rust gamedev on the web. Huge progress has been made towards a full game stack being available more-or-less &quot;for free:&quot; most of the foundational crates have available web support, in one way or another.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>The graphics API of Quicksilver isn't as dire need of a rework as the <a href="../quicksilver-chanukah-2019-day-6">lifecycle APIs</a>, but I wanted to take the next breaking change as an opportunity to address some long-standing issues. </p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>Quicksilver has always had some major API compromises to deliver on its core promise: write a game once, and it targets desktop and the web with no changes. The two ugliest compromises are the <code>State</code> and <code>Asset</code> APIs, for managing your application's core loop and file loading, respectively.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p><code>golem</code> is a mostly-safe graphics API that targets OpenGL 3.2 and WebGL 1 that helps make writing GL less painful.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>With the recent update to <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit"><code>winit</code></a>, it gained web support! This is great, and it means that Quicksilver doesn't need to have its own parallel implementation of windowing. However, there is room for an abstraction that's a little simpler than Winit, and takes advantage of <code>async/.await</code>, which is where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/blinds"><code>blinds</code></a> comes in.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Often your application might want to store gamestate or configurations, but the web has no filesystem access. Additionally, you don't want to just dump files in the user's home directory; each desktop operating system has a different preferred location for storing application-specific data, and often different locations for different kinds of data.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="https://crates.io/crates/gestalt"><code>gestalt</code></a>, a library that bundles up your data and stores it away so you don't have to.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>This year saw the release of <code>async/.await</code> in stable Rust, marking a huge change in how asynchronous code is written. Previously, one would have to chain a series of combinators onto a <code>Future</code> instance to accomplish asyncrhonous tasks. In Quicksilver, this was used for asset loading (for compatibility with the web backend), and has been a frequent source of pain.</p>

                </a>
            </header>
            <p>I started this year with a <a href="../state-of-quicksilver-feb-2019">blog post about the state of Quicksilver</a> where I set a goal for myself: get web support for important game development crates upstreamed. At the end of the year, I'm happy to update this work (by me and many others!) has been a success, and the core of Rust's game ecosystem is now-web enabled. In the future, I want to write a brief overview of those changes, but for now I want to focus on their relevance to Quicksilver.</p>

                    <h3> The State of Quicksilver Feb 2019 </h3>
                </a>
            </header>
            <p>For anyone who doesn't know, <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> is my 2D game framework that targets desktop and web. It is a pure-Rust library that focuses on ergonomics and simplicity.</p>
<p>Quicksilver is part of a small (but growing) set of Rust game engines. Notable are the Amethyst project, an open-source game engine, and ggez, a LOVE-inspired 2D game framework.
Increasingly it is practical to build an entire game with only the Rust toolchain: winit provides windowing, a variety of crates allow access to platform graphics APIs, rodio provides sound, rusttype for font rendering, etc. A pure-Rust game framework is getting easier to make all the time.</p>

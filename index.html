<p>Iâ€™m a full-time software engineer and a some-time writer.</p>
<p>My open-source projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/">GitHub</a>;
I sometimes talk about them <a href="posts/">here on my blog.</a> I developed and maintained a game framework called <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a library for writing <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> games for desktop and web. Iâ€™ve also made a handful of <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/rebound">small</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/hellevator">video</a> <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/interplanet">games</a>.

        <p>In the last few years I've switched fully to Neovim, and embraced the lua scripting and built-in LSP support. Most development I do these days tends to be TypeScript or Rust, and my editor's integration with tooling like prettier, rustfmt, rust-analyzer, and tsc is great! Having recently started doing some work in Unity, however, I discovered that I would have to get my hands dirty for a good C# experience.</p>

        <p>Recently I found myself tracking down a handful of regressions: bugs I knew hadn't existed just a week or two before. I vaguely knew that there was a git command that could help me, but I had never really put it to serious use. Now that I have used it, I find myself falling in love with <code>git bisect</code>.</p>

        <p>If your browser is set to dark mode by default, you've probably noticed the site looks different! I now have some dark mode CSS, so this blog isn't eye-searingly white if everything else is dark on your screen.</p>

        <p>So this is a post that's been bouncing around my head for a while, in one form or another. I created and maintain <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, a 2D game framework for creating games for desktop and the web. The reason I'm writing this post is that I also haven't <em>used</em> Quicksilver to make anything for over a year.</p>

        <p>This blog post has been a long time delayed, but late is better than never! The Quicksilver alpha is humming along, with bugs and API problems being addressed. While that work continues, I want to unveil <code>elefont</code>, a crate that I've developed for font caching.</p>

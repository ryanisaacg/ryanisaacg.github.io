				<h5> Written In </h5>
				This project was written in Python, using Pygame for graphics, Flask for network communication, and Twilio for SMS integration
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				My friend and I  wanted to create an interesting local-multiplayer experience and Twilio was a sponsor, so after messing around 
				with a few ideas this is what we settled on.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> How does it play? </h5>
				The game uses the Twilio API to read SMS messages from various players, and applies the actions to the game server, 
				which is presented with pygame.

                <p>Out with the old, in with the new! After some frustration with Hugo, I've moved to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a> and some light CSS.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I wanted to write a new blog post regarding <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/elefont">elefont</a> and Quicksilver's new text rendering system, but I  was dreading making a post on the site. Hugo had proved opaque and fragile for me, and its blizzard of configuration options wasn't making things much easier. Plus, something small broke when I tried to use the latest Hugo version on Windows to re-build the site. I wasn't much interested in tracking down a changelog and bringing my blog up to the latest version, so I decided Hugo had to go.</p>
<p>Initially I considered writing my own static site generator. <em>How hard could it be?</em> I asked myself. Then I thought about generating an RSS feed, and parsing front-matter, and maybe setting up a SASS compilation pipeline. <em>No thanks!</em> I instead settled on Zola, primarily because it seems to be the right combination of simple and expressive. Secondarily, it's written in Rust, which I appreciate. Using Zola has been very nice so far; I feel more like I'm programming a little language designed to make website-making easy. Previous experiences with Hugo and Jekyll felt more like wrestling the generator into doing what I wanted; Zola is a breath of fresh air by comparison.</p>
<p>Currently the site is very light on styling. So far I like the look of it, but for how long is anyone's guess.</p>
<p>I hope this means I can get some posts up about Quicksilver soon; there's been a lot of evolution since the end of last year, when I was just starting on the new alpha versions. I ended up forgoing a State of Quicksilver 2020, for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../quicksilver-chanukah-2019">The Quicksilver Chanukah posts</a> covered a lot of my plans</li>
<li>I wanted to wait until the 0.4 release is closer to feature-complete</li>
<li>And mostly, I've been very busy</li>
</ul>

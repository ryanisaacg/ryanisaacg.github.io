<meta name="description" content="My focus in my fourth week was almost entirely on the Recurse Game Jam. I teamed up with Robin on her game puzdug, a roguelike puzzle dungeon in x86 assembly.

We did briefly have a build that worked on a DOS-less Qemu instance, but there is a 512 byte limit for the boot sector which we quickly shot past. The final product was a whopping 1KB and included fog of war, player movement, enemies, a win and loss condition, and color ASCII graphics. I loved working in such an unfamiliar and challenging environment. There’s a serenity to making a game with such an uphill climb, because it took pressure off my mind to make the game impressive. Shipping anything written in assembly is impressive enough, I think.">

      <p>My focus in my fourth week was almost entirely on the Recurse Game Jam. I teamed up with <a href="https://metavee.github.io/blog/">Robin</a> on her game puzdug<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>, a roguelike puzzle dungeon in x86 assembly. She had set out to make a game that fit in the boot sector, so that it could be played bare-metal. We did briefly have a build that worked on a DOS-less Qemu instance, but there is a 512 byte limit for the boot sector which we quickly shot past. The final product was a whopping 1KB and included fog of war, player movement, enemies, a win and loss condition, and color ASCII graphics. I loved working in such an unfamiliar and challenging environment. There’s a serenity to making a game with such an uphill climb, because it took pressure off my mind to make the game impressive. Shipping anything written in assembly is impressive enough, I think.</p>
<p>I also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used Siri Shortcuts to parse a web endpoint for my local train times, and <a href="path-times">blogged about it.</a></li>
<li>Finished up my <a href="learning-lsps">first LSP blog post</a></li>
<li>Made Hindsight, my “20 second break after 20 minutes of screen” app, a little smarter. Previously it checked if the Zoom app was running to avoid interrupting me in a call; now it checks to see if my camera is on instead</li>
<li>Went down a rabbit hole with wasm and dynamic linking. I didn’t end up achieving what I wanted to, but I learned some things that will hopefully make for an interesting blog post soon</li>

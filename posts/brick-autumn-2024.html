            <p><a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/brick">Brick</a> is a hobby programming language I’ve been working on for around a year. I previously <a href="programming-language-for-fun">blogged a little about my goals</a>, but you don’t need to read that post to understand this one.</p>
<p>Until now, most of my work on Brick has been catching up to my initial plan. I stole from languages like Rust, Zig, Austral, or Go; those languages allowed me to understand the tradeoffs of my decisions before I committed to them. For about a year I was in pure implementation mode, rarely making design decisions of any significance. Now I’m shifting into a slightly more exploratory mode as I try to dial in what programming in Brick should feel like.</p>
<p>When asked about the design of Brick, I usually say something like “a simpler Rust” or “Rust meets Go”. People often assume this means I’m jettisoning the borrow checker and move semantics in favor of a garbage collector, and then I have to explain that’s the opposite of my goal. Rust has a better safety story than imperative, garbage-collected languages like Python or Java: it defines away the “spooky action at a distance” of aliased, mutable pointers. It does this while keeping the imperative programming model, unlike Clojure or Haskell which adopt a model of functional, immutable programming. I’d like to keep that safety story and not introduce any spooky action at a distance to Brick.</p>
<p>Where I want to differ from Rust is threefold: references, polymorphism, and auto-cloned collections.</p>
<p>In Rust references are first-class, which means they can be stored in data structures or returned from functions. This gives rise to lifetime annotations, which can be intimidating for new Rust programmers. Brick’s references are second-class; a reference can never escape the scope it is created in. This greatly simplifies borrow-checking and means the programmer never has to specify lifetimes. It also reduces the power of the language and may require additional indirection or cloning; I’m okay with paying that cost in exchange for simplicity.</p>
<p>Rust’s trait system is a large source of complexity in the language. TODO</p>
<p>All of Rust’s default collections are mutable, which makes perfect sense for Rust. A <code>Vec</code> introduces as little overhead as possible, compared to directly indexing chunks of memory. The downside is that creating copies is an expensive operation: the entire collection has to be copied, if it can’t be passed around via a shared reference. You <em>can</em> build persistent data structures in Rust (check out the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im"><code>im</code> crate</a>), but they come with an annoying caveat. Every place you want to create a new, cheap copy of the structure you’ll have to call <code>clone</code>. The same goes for small copies of strings, or a reference-counted pointer: <code>clone</code> every time<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" aria-describedby="footnotes-label" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a></sup>.

<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>The reference-counted-pointer case can actually be pretty annoying in Rust when working with an <code>Arc</code> for async or thread related code. There’s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2407">a long running Github issue</a> about automatically cloning values into closures, there’s <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2024/06/21/claim-auto-and-otherwise/">a blog post from earlier this summer</a> about adding a new <code>Claim</code> trait for this purpose, and discussions of autocloning generally crop up over time. I’m not sure I want an autoclone system in Rust itself, nor am I sure how to design one for Rust. <a href="#fnref1" aria-label="Back to reference 1" role="doc-backlink" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

      <description>What is Quicksilver? For anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, Quicksilver is my 2D game framework that targets desktop and web. It is a pure-Rust library that focuses on ergonomics and simplicity.

Notable are the Amethyst project, an open-source game engine, and ggez, a LOVE-inspired 2D game framework. Increasingly it is practical to build an entire game with only the Rust toolchain: winit provides windowing, a variety of crates allow access to platform graphics APIs, rodio provides sound, rusttype for font rendering, etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m studing Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. My main area of experience is PC game development, and I have had internships for both web and mobile applications. Most of my side projects are written either C, Java, Python, or Rust.
Academic Experience I study Computer Science in the school of Arts and Sciences at Rutgers University. I haven&amp;rsquo;t found time for an official minor, though I try take classes on linguistics and sociology when I&amp;rsquo;m able.</description>

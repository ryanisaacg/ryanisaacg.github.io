				<h5> Written In </h5>
				While I originally planned to use Java, the project was created with Game Maker Studio

				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				This project was actually created for a history assignment, and therefore starts with a bit of historical exposition.

				<h5> How does it play? </h5>
				The player controls the <i>CSS Merrimack</i> to fight the <i>USS Monitor</i> in a naval battle. 
				They have the options to accelerate, deccelerate, bank to port, bank to staboard, and firing port or starboard guns.

				<h5> Why play as the Confederacy? </h5>
				Originally, I planned to have the player take the role of the <i>Monitor</i>, but found it much easier to create a 
				computer-controlled opponent for the <i>Monitor</i>, because of its rotating turrets. Additionally, human players 
				found maneuvering to land a broadside more satisfying than controlling a turret.

        <p>Around a year ago, I decided to use Neovim as my editor for working on Unity-based projects. After <a href="TODO">some involved setup</a>, I thought I had everything just how I liked it. Then my autocomplete broke one too many times, and I knew it just wasn't worth the hassle. It was time to bite the bullet and use VSCode; but could I do that without giving up Vim?</p>

        <p>In the last few years I've switched fully to Neovim, and embraced the lua scripting and built-in LSP support. Most development I do these days tends to be TypeScript or Rust, and my editor's integration with tooling like prettier, rustfmt, rust-analyzer, and tsc is great! Having recently started doing some work in Unity, however, I discovered that I would have to get my hands dirty for a good C# experience.</p>

        <p>Recently I found myself tracking down a handful of regressions: bugs I knew hadn't existed just a week or two before. I vaguely knew that there was a git command that could help me, but I had never really put it to serious use. Now that I have used it, I find myself falling in love with <code>git bisect</code>.</p>

        <p>If your browser is set to dark mode by default, you've probably noticed the site looks different! I now have some dark mode CSS, so this blog isn't eye-searingly white if everything else is dark on your screen.</p>

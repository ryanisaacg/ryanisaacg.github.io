				<h5> Written In </h5>
				This project was written in the Godot Engine.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				I used the project to learn the Godot engine, and also to experiment with game design.
				The game may not be extremely effective but it was a good learning experience for learning to convey emotions through mechanics.

				<h5> How does it play? </h5>
				The game attempts to use game mechanics to convey the five stages of grief to the player. <br/>
                First it forces the player to repeat the same actions in hope they will succeed, modelling <b>Denial.</b> <br/>
                Second it puts the player through a frustrating platforming puzzles, modelling <b>Anger.</b> <br/>
                Third , modelling <b>Bargaining</b>, the player must give up their ability to jump temporarily. <br/>
                Fourth, as the player progresses through what should be an easy segment, their jump weakens and their movement slows, 
                modelling <b>Depression.</b> <br/>
                Fifth, a puzzle forces the player to achieve <b> Acceptance. </b>

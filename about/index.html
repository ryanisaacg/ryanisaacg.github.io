<p>I&rsquo;m a computer science student and a software developer, currently looking for full-time positions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m studying Computer Science at Rutgers University New Brunswick in the School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. My main area of experience is PC game development, and I have had internships for both web and mobile applications. Most of my side projects are written either C, Java, Python, or Rust.</p>

<h3 id="academic-experience">Academic Experience</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m a senior studying Computer Science at Rutgers University; I&rsquo;ve tried to take a wide variety of upper-level classes, with an interest in improving the average person&rsquo;s access to computing power.</p>

<h3 id="professional-experience">Professional Experience</h3>

<p>This past summer (2019) I worked as an intern at Facebook <a href="https://connectivity.fb.com/analytics/">on the Analytics team in the Connectivity organization</a>, where I worked full-stack on both front-end products and the backend services to power them. On the frontend, I made improvements to tools to automate previously manual processes, and on the backend I implemented a new more resilient model to represent polygons in map data.</p>

<p>Since late 2018, I&rsquo;ve worked in the <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/lcsr/">Laboratory for Computer Science Research</a> at Rutgers University, focusing on improving the auto-grading functionality used by our introduction-level Computer Science courses like <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/introduction-to-computer-science">CS 111, Introduction to Computer Science</a>. I&rsquo;ve made small tweaks to the web app where students submit grades and worked on improving the existing grading program, as well as expanding the auto-grader to new courses.</p>

<p>Last year (2018) and the year before (2017) I worked at <a href="https://vydia.com/">Vydia</a>. In 2018, I worked largely on moving backend services from a monolithic EC2 instance to a serverless framework via AWS Lambda and Fargate, which decreased processing costs and time for critical functions like media uploads. In 2017, I was more focused on the frontend, and worked on user experience improvements like a First-Time User Interface to teach the functionality of the mobile app.</p>

<p>In 2016, I worked as a research assistant at Monmouth University on a project called DYNAMO, which explored dynamic ways to track moving objects in a given field. Largely we focused on bluetooth, RFID, and machine vision. My work was to mostly to turn gathered data into a viewable format, first by converting from a series of Excel files to a MongoDB database and then by creating a web app to visualize the data; the app used a small Python backend with a Typescript/jQuery frontend.</p>

<h3 id="rust-gamedev">Rust Gamedev</h3>

<p>You may know me from my work in open-source Rust game libraries. I&rsquo;m the developer of <a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> and I contribute to other libraries in the ecosystem like <a href="https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit">winit</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gilrs-project/gilrs">gilrs</a>. My main focus is ease-of-use and web deployments, with the goal of making it zero-effort to write a game in Rust that works both natively and on the web.</p>

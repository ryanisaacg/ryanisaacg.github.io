            <p>This year I've been playing <a href="https://liberigothica.itch.io/fellowship-a-tabletop-adventure-game">Fellowship 2e</a>, a fantasy adventure RPG that's <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/">Powered by the Apocalypse</a>, and I have a few gripes with an otherwise great game. Since session 1, I've felt like the core move Get Away needs re-writing, and I decided to take a stab at it.</p>

            <p>For the past couple years I've been playing around with tabletop RPG design. My goal was to make a comprehensive hack of a game like <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a> or <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/spire-rpg/"><em>Spire: The City Must Fall</em></a>,
but none of my attempts panned out. I found myself caught in a rut of moving from big project to big project as they collapsed under their own weight. To break the cycle, I set myself a challenge: make an RPG (or at least <em>something</em> RPG-related) every month of 2021.</p>

				<h5> Written In </h5>
				This project was actually originally written in Python, but we switched to Java for performance reasons. 
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> Why does it exist? </h5>
				It was created as a school project for a physics class.

				<h5> The Overworld </h5>
				The game works with a tile-based overworld that allows the player to collect resources, which they use to solve circuit puzzles. 
				When presented with a broken door, fire suppression unit, or escape pod launcher, the player can open a circuit interface.
			</section>
			<section> 
				<h5> The Circuits </h5>
				The meat of the game occurs in the circuit interface, where they can slot in batteries, resistors, and power output 
				sources. Using circuit laws such as Ohm's Law (V = I * R) and Kirchoff's Loop Rules, the player can determine the 
				correct amount of current to feed to the source. 
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5> The Danger </h5>
				It's not all fun and games- the station is on fire and the player must avoid being burned in the unforgiving vacuum of space.
				To keep parts of the station safe, the player must repair doors to slow the fire's spread and fire suppresion machines 
				to actually put out the flames.

			<section>
				<a href="https://github.com/fwumdesoft/project8-java"> <h5> Cosmic Circuitry </h5> </a>
				A school assignment (codenamed Project 8) that requires players to use Kirchoff's Laws to solve circuit puzzles
				<aside>
					<h2> Cosmic Circuitry </h2>
					<div class="img"> img/cc_gif.gif</div>
					This project was actually originally written in Python, but we switched to Java for performance reasons. 
					The game works with a tile-based overworld that allows the player to collect resources, which they use to solve circuit puzzles. 
					When presented with a broken door, fire suppression unit, or escape pod launcher, the player could open a circuit interface, 
					where they can slot in batteries, resistors, and power output sources. Using circuit laws such as Ohm's Law (V = I * R) and Kirchoff's Loop Rules,
					the player can determine the correct amount of current to feed to the source. However, it's not all fun and games- the station is on fire and 
					the player must avoid being burned in the unforgiving vacuum of space.

				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/LD33"> <h5> Escape From Science </h5> </a>
				A top-down escape game that I created for Ludum Dare 33, using libGDX and Java
				<aside>
					<h2> Escape from Science </h2>
					<div class="img">"img/science.gif"</div>
					The theme for Ludum Dare 33 was "You Are the Monster," but the game doesn't follow the theme too closely. 
					It tasks the player with escaping from a variety of rooms with deadly obstacles such as turrets, mines, and pressure plates.

				<a href="https://github.com/fwumdesoft/HackRU_VIII"> <h5> HackRU Goes to Space </h5> </a>
				A HackRU project that I worked on with my friends where players texts commands to pilot a spaceship, using Python
				<!-- TODO: Twilio link -->
				<aside>
					<h2> HackRU Goes to Space </h2>
					The game uses the Twilio API to read SMS messages from various players, and applies the actions to the game server, 
					which is presented with pygame. This was our first time at a hackathon, and I think our project came out very well.
				</aside>

			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/fwumdesoft/Ironclads"> <h5> Ironclads </h5> </a>
				A school project that depicts the Battle of Hampton Roads, a naval conflict in the Civil War, using Game Maker
				<aside>
					<h2> Ironclads </h2>
					Hampton Roads was the first naval battle to feature ironclad ships- hence the game name. 
					It pitted the <i> USS Merrimack </i> and the <i> CSS Monitor </i> against one another. 
					The <i> Merrimack </i> had a key advantage: a rotating turret, allowing the ship to fire without exposing its broadside.
					The player takes the role of the <i> Monitor </i>, pitted against a computer-controlled <i> Merrimack </i>. 
				</aside>

			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/Meteors"> <h5> Meteors </h5> </a>
				A game that is heavily inspired by Atari's Ateroids, using a custom language and HTML5
				<aside>
					<h2> Meteors </h2>
					The game features a player-controlled ship against an alien AI and a few asteroids. 
					When an asteroid is destroyed, its fragments spread around the level. 
					Asteroids, bullets, and both ships wrap around the edge of the game world, requiring players to considering geometry in a different way.
					Each time the alien is killed, the player gains a point, but the alien also becomes more powerful and more accurate.

			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/FiveStages"> <h5> Five Stages</h5> </a>
				An experimental game that explores the Five Stages of grief, using Godot engine
				<aside> 
					<h2> Five Stages </h2>
					The game attempts to use game mechanics to convey the five stages of grief to the player. <br/>
					First it forces the player to repeat the same actions in hope they will succeed, modelling <b>Denial.</b> <br/>
					Second it puts the player through a frustrating platforming puzzles, modelling <b>Anger.</b> <br/>
					Third , modelling <b>Bargaining</b>, the player must give up their ability to jump temporarily. <br/>
					Fourth, as the player progresses through what should be an easy segment, their jump weakens and their movement slows, 
					modelling <b>Depression.</b> <br/>
					Fifth, a puzzle forces the player to achieve <b> Acceptance. </b> <br/>
					The game may not be extremely effective but it was a good learning experience for learning to convey emotions through mechanics.

		<h4> Systems Applications / Compilers </h4>
		<article>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/AST"> <h5> AST </h5> </a>
				A small project that converts an Abstract Syntax Tree into C source code
				<aside>
					<h2> AST </h2>
					An Abstract Syntax Tree is an intermediate representation between source code and the compiler's output. 
					Each node is an operator or value, and each leaf is a value. 
					This project was my first step towards writing compilers that targeted C, as it was intend to turn a data structure into executable C code.
					I didn't wrap every feature of the C language with an AST feature, but enough that I learned critical parts of writing compiler infrastructure.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/fwum"> <h5> Fwum </h5> </a>
				A work-in-progress programming language with a compiler
				<aside>
					<h2> Fwum </h2>
					Fwum was created out of my frustration with other programming languages. 
					I found garbage collection unsatisfactory for game development, and reference counting just as bad, leaving just a few languages.
					Mainly, the candidates were C and C++, which are the too hot and too cold of a Goldilocks metaphor. 
					C wasn't quite featured enough for me, but C++ had too much complexity. 
					I created a grammar, a parser for the grammar, a semantic analyzer, a basic linker, and an output to C as a compile target for the language. 
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/IslandScript"> <h5> IslandScript </h5> </a>
				A Python-Inspired language that compiles to Javascript
				<aside>
					<h2> Island Script </h2>
					Island Script was my first compiler, intended to make the syntax of Javascript more like Python. 
					At the time, I believed semantic indentation was obviously the correct path, and wanted to be able to use it for web development.
					The language is nearly semantically identical to Javascript, with only minor semantic tweaks.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/Snakefile"> <h5> Snakefile </h5> </a>
				A build system in Python that is similar to Makefile (pun intended)
				<aside>
					<h2> Snakefile </h2>
					When I first started creating complex C projects, I was using a simple Makefile that mapped each source file to an object file. 
					However, changes to dependent headers would often break builds, which meant I was in need of a better solution. 
					Autotools was too complex, and I didn't like that CMake required learning an entire new Domain-Specific Language, so I created Snakefile.
					It is intended to allow creating complex, turing-complete build files and to be easy to configure. 
					However, incompatibility with Visual Studio project files eventually turned me away from the project.

		<h4> Desktop Software / Command Line Utilities </h4>
		<article>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/ChemicalWriter"> <h5> Chemical Writer </h5> </a>
				A program that converts a string into atomic symbols, using Python
				<aside>
					<h2> Chemical Writer </h2>
					This is more of a toy than a utility, but it's fun to play around with. It converts "BACON" to Barium, Carbon, Oxygen, and Nitrogen (BaCON). 
					It is guaranteed to find a solution if it exists, and will prioritize single-element.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/CLChat"> <h5> CLChat </h5> </a>
				A basic chatroom that runs over TCP/IP, using Java
				<aside>
					<h2> CLChat </h2>
					This was mostly for me to learn the basiscs of a networked TCP application development and creating a server that can manage many clients at once.
					The server should scale to an arbitrary number of clients, but the architecture means it will probably decrease greatly in performance under
					heavy message load.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/fwumdestego"> <h5> FwumDeStego </h5> </a>
				A stegnonography program that can encode text in images, using Java
				<aside>
					<h2> FwumDeStego </h2>
					The program converts a string to a bitstring and maps it over the RGB values of the image. Even values indicate a 0 in the bitstring and odd 
					values indicate a 1 in the bitstring. To read the value from the image, it follows the same order and uses modulo to read the string. 
					The changes to the RGB values are invisible to the human eye but allow for the transmission of information.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/speech-generator"> <h5> Speech Generator </h5> </a>
				A program that takes written human speech, analyzes it, and attempts to create the most similar string of words, using Python
				<aside>
					<h2> Speech Generator </h2>
					The program analyzes what words follow others most often, and attempts to reconstruct the same pattern and write in a similar fashion.
					It is a rather naive implementation that only takes a basic context, and most often generates nonsense. 
					However, this is a basic demo of what a Markov chain is like.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section> 
				<a href="https://github.com/ryanisaacg/spacey"> <h5> Spacey </h5> </a>
				A program that manages the type of indentation a piece of source code has, using C++
				<aside>
					<h2> Spacey </h2>
					Especially in Python code, mixing of tabs and spaces to indent can cause problems. 
					The objective of the program is to take all of the indentation and make it all tabs or all spaces.
					It's a relatively simple program, which I wrote to learn string manipulation in C++.
